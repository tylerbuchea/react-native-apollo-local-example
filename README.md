# React Native Apollo Example

## Setup

```bash
yarn install
yarn start
```

## Getting Started

I kept this repo very simple all GraphQL and React Native code is
contained within `App.js` so you only have to tweak that file to play
around with this project.

The GraphQL server used in this example is https://api.graph.cool/simple/v1/cixos23120m0n0173veiiwrjr
You can visit that address and run queries against the API.
